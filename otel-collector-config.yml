# 1. Define the receivers (how data comes IN)
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317

# 2. Define the exporters (how data goes OUT)
exporters:
  otlp/jaeger:
    endpoint: jaeger:4317
    tls:
      insecure: true
  otlphttp:
    endpoint: http://loki:3100/otlp
    tls:
      insecure: true
  prometheus:
    endpoint: 0.0.0.0:8889
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed

# 3. Define the processors (how data is transformed in the middle)
processors:
  batch:
    # How long to wait before sending a batch, even if it's not full.
    timeout: 1s
    # How many items (spans, metrics, logs) to put in a batch before sending.
    send_batch_size: 512

# 4. Define the service pipelines (connecting receivers, processors, and exporters)
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/jaeger, debug]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [prometheus, debug]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp, debug]
